# whether weather

*whether* is a small web app that shows you the weather. 

It lives [here](https://whetherrrrr.netlify.app).

## Description

I wanted to design the UI for a quick and light React weather app, and have a go at building it myself!

The groundwork for the app is [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Reny0cTTv24&t=57s) by Slobodan Gajic/freeCodeCamp.

*whether* shows a 24-hour forecast and information about sunrise, sunset, and moon phases, because why not! It also shows a general forecast for the week ahead.

To develop *whether*, I used React, building entirely with function components and Hooks. I also used OpenWeather One Call API 3.0 to retrieve weather data.

## Features
* The app geolocates the user using their IP, and then...
* shows them the weather at their location!
* Afterwards, the user can put in any other location, and show the weather there.
